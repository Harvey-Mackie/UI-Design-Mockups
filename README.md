# UI Design Mockups
The application allows developers to **instantly** display created prototypes in a variety of devices, from mobile to desktop. Create multiple wireframe mockups **hassle-free** therefore enabling more time spent coding/designing the applications instead of the static mockups.

## Requirements :
1. Download and install [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/2.4.13.6).
2. Numpy

```Dos
$ pip install numpy
```
3. PyQt5
```Dos
$ pip install PyQt5
```

## Steps
- Insert image
- Choose device for mockup
  - Mobile devices page orientation can be altered 
      (Landscape or Portrait)
- View .PNG stored in your directory

## Mockup Devices
- Tablet (iPad) 
- Phone (iPhone)
- Laptop (Macbook)
- Monitor (Mac)

## Import Image Recommendations

#### Exported Images:
Large Images - 900 pixels. Small Images - 450 pixels.
